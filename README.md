# Hello Everyone
* This is a beginner project , I work hard at this. 
* I want an opinian or better make a pull request.

## What about it
 First of all, it's a miny web site made just with react , boostrap , html , css.
 It's about my favorite Youtubers and theyr best videos (in my opinion).
 Feel free to take a look, it's not big of a deal but I learned a lot.
